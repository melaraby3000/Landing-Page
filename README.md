# Landing Page Project

This is my first project, and I hope to be successful in using the tools that I learned to implement what is required of me in this project.

A fourth section has been added in html

Dynamic sections created

I have added the sections via JavaScript.

I created a function to create a link for each section.

Modified the active class properties for both section and link.



Partition monitoring function to identify the section in the viewport and its link
   * Loop over entries (sections)
   * Get an active link using the department ID in the viewport
   * Add an active category to the section in the viewport
   * Add an active category to the section link
   * Edit site hash directory because I prevent default behavior
   * Remove active categories
